Business Question:
How likely is a regulated utility operations department to exceed its annual Operations & Maintenance (O&M) budget given historical volatility in labor, materials, and unplanned maintenance costs?

Objective:
Quantify annual budget risk using Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability and magnitude of budget overruns, supporting forecast confidence and cost-management decisions.


Key Assumptions:
Costs are modeled monthly and aggregated annually.
Labor, materials, and maintenance costs follow independent normal distributions.
Annual volatility differs by cost category based on operational characteristics.
Budget threshold is set at expected cost plus a contingency buffer.
All data is synthetic and intended to represent a typical regulated utility operations unit.
